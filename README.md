# Watch-My-Pet
It is a mobile application where pet owners meet with pet sitters.

**Watch my pet** is an application that allows you to list the sitters available for your pet in the location and date ranges you choose, view the caregiver information and the price they charge for the care service, and create a reservation.

### What is a Host?
The host is usually a pet sitter who owns a pet.
Hosts register with the Watch my pet application, save their current profile information to the system, and create a host posting by entering the location, pet and date information suitable for them.
Thus, host seekers can choose the suitable host for their pet from the host postings registered in the system and create reservations.

### How does it work ?
First of all, you can log in by clicking the login or registration buttons on the welcome screen, or you can register if you do not have an account.
If you are not registered in the system, the system will direct you to the profile page to update your profile information at the first login after the registration process, if you are already registered, you will be directed to the main page after the login process.

It is expected that the user will select the badges indicating the qualifications they have and add them to their profile.
